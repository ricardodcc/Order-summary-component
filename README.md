## My process
-> This week I learned about SASS, the pre-processing CSS tool. I learned about the use of @extends, @mixin, @use, @import and hwo we can use programming logic ( for and each loop, if else ) in my last day workshop and this project was the first one that I made using SASS. Looking for what i made, IÂ´m really proud of it and ready to make another one using it.

-> I started this mini project by coding all the HTML needed and then adding SASS files.

-> There is a main SASS file ( main.scss ) that importes all olher SASS files with the objective to get a more organized and scalable project with the intencion to get the best pratices at this early stage of my learning.

-> Finnaly i transform all SASS content into a styles.css file and call it in the index.html
